//Description: Deactivates the elevator.

//At this point, this elevator will process no more new requests (that is, passengers waiting on floors).
//However, before an elevator completely stops, it must offload all of its current passengers.
//Only after the elevator is empty may it be deactivated (state = OFFLINE).
//This function returns 1 if the elevator is already in the process of deactivating, and 0 otherwise.

int stop_elevator()
{
	int status =0;
	//finish offloading, don't allow pickups
	//set state to offline
	// return 1 if elevator in process of deactivating
	//return 0 otherwise

	return 0;
